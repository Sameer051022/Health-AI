# Llama Model Integration with LLMediCare

## Overview

This document explains how the downloaded Llama 2 model is integrated with the LLMediCare frontend chat interface.

## Integration Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Settings Configuration**

   - The AI model type is set to 'llama' in `medicare_backend/settings.py`
   - OpenAI API key configuration is commented out as we're using the local Llama model

2. **AI Assistant Service**

   - Enhanced error handling in the Llama model initialization
   - Improved chat response generation with conversation history context
   - Added fallback mechanisms when the model fails to load or generate responses
   - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

3. **Chat Response Generation**
   - The service now uses a conversational prompt template that includes chat history
   - Responses are generated with proper context from previous messages
   - Rule-based fallback responses are provided when the model is unavailable

### Frontend Changes

1. **Chat Interface**
   - Added loading indicator while waiting for AI responses
   - Improved error handling with more descriptive error messages
   - Better handling of different response formats from the backend

## Using the Llama Model

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Ensure the Llama model file (`llama-2-7b-chat.gguf`) is downloaded and placed in the `models/` directory
   - Install all required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Starting the Application**

   - Run the Django backend server: `python backend/manage.py runserver`
   - Start the frontend development server: `cd frontend && npm start`

3. **Troubleshooting**
   - If the model fails to load, check the server logs for detailed error messages
   - Ensure your system has at least 8GB of available RAM
   - If you encounter performance issues, try restarting the server

## Technical Details

- The Llama model is loaded using the LlamaCpp integration from LangChain
- Chat responses are generated using a LangChain prompt template
- The model uses optimized parameters for better performance on consumer hardware
- A fallback mechanism is in place to use rule-based responses if the model fails

## Future Improvements

- Add GPU acceleration support for faster inference
- Implement streaming responses for better user experience
- Add fine-tuning capabilities for medical domain adaptation
- Implement caching for frequently asked questions
